# Lambda Calculus
Lambda Calculus is a tiny functional language for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application [1]. It's ideas form the basis of nearly all functional programming including ML, Haskell, and Scheme [2]. Lambda Calculus is a very small language, and is a good starting point for studying functional programming language design and implementation.
